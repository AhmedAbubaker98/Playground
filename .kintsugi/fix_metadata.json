  "thought_process": "1.  **Analyze the Failure**: The previous fix failed despite attempting to mock network requests and control the clock. This suggests either the network interception was too narrow (filtering by `resourceType: 'fetch' | 'xhr'` might have missed the request if it was classified differently) or the application requires a specific response structure that my mock didn't provide. It's also possible the page wasn't fully hydrated before interaction.\n2.  **Identify the Root Cause**: \n    *   **Network**: The request might not be a `fetch` or `xhr` (could be a beacon or other type), or the method might be `PUT`/`PATCH`. The `resourceType` filter is risky.\n    *   **Hydration**: If the React/JS bundle hasn't executed, the 'Save' button might be visible but not yet functional (no event listener). Clicking it does nothing.\n    *   **Response**: The app might expect specific fields in the JSON response.\n3.  **Formulate the Fix**: \n    *   **Hydration**: Add `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` to ensure the app is interactive.\n    *   **Broad Network Mock**: Remove the `resourceType` filter. Intercept *any* `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH` request. Return a richer JSON response `{ success: true, status: 'ok', message: 'saved' }` to cover common expectations.\n    *   **Clock**: Keep the clock installation and `runFor` to handle any client-side debouncing or polling.\n    *   **Timeout**: Keep the 60s global timeout.",
