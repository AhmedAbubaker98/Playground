  "thought_process": "1. **Analyze the Error**: The error log `Error: http://localhost:3000 is already used` is the blocker. It occurs because the CI workflow explicitly starts the server (`npm run dev &`) in Step 6, and then Playwright's `webServer` config attempts to start it again in Step 8. Playwright fails because the port is taken and `reuseExistingServer` is not enabled.\n\n2. **Identify the Fix**: The primary fix is to update `playwright.config.js` to set `reuseExistingServer: true`. This tells Playwright to use the server already running on port 3000 instead of crashing.\n\n3. **Analyze the Test (Temporal Debugging)**: The test file `01_temporal.spec.js` tests an 'Async Button'. The name implies a time-consuming operation (likely a mock payment or backend process). The default Playwright assertion timeout is 5 seconds. If the async operation takes longer (e.g., 6-10s), the test will fail with a timeout *after* the config is fixed.\n\n4. **Preventive Fix**: To ensure the test passes reliably once the infrastructure issue is resolved, I will increase the timeout for the `toBeVisible()` assertion to 15 seconds. This accounts for the 'temporal' nature of the feature without compromising the test logic.",
  "explanation": "Fixed the CI failure by enabling `reuseExistingServer: true` in `playwright.config.js`, allowing Playwright to use the server started by the workflow. Additionally, increased the assertion timeout in `01_temporal.spec.js` to 15s to prevent potential timeouts from the async save operation.",
