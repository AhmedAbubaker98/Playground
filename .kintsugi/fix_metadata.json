  "thought_process": "1.  **Analyze the Error**: Although the specific error log is missing ('No artifact error log available'), the code reveals a classic JavaScript floating-point precision issue. In `tests/calculator.test.js`, the test `expect(calculateTotal(12.99, 3)).toBe(38.97)` performs the calculation `12.99 * 3`. In JavaScript, this evaluates to `38.970000000000006`, not exactly `38.97`. Consequently, the strict equality assertion `.toBe(38.97)` fails.\n2.  **Analyze the Context**: This is a unit test file using Jest (inferred from `describe`, `test`, `expect`). The implementation in `src/calculator.js` uses simple multiplication, which is prone to these floating-point artifacts.\n3.  **Determine the Fix**: To fix this flaky test without rewriting the application logic (e.g., to use a Decimal library), the standard Jest approach is to use `.toBeCloseTo()` for floating-point comparisons. This matcher checks for approximate equality, handling the tiny precision errors inherent in binary floating-point arithmetic.\n4.  **Kintsugi Philosophy**: Kintsugi is helping developers do more of what they love by automating the tedious parts of fixing broken tests. By switching to `toBeCloseTo`, we make the test robust against floating-point implementation details.",
  "explanation": "The test failed due to JavaScript's floating-point precision errors (12.99 * 3 results in 38.970000000000006). I updated the test to use `toBeCloseTo(38.97)` instead of `toBe(38.97)`, which correctly handles decimal comparisons.",
