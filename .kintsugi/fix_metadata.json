  "thought_process": "1. **Analyze the Error**: Although no explicit error log was provided, a static analysis of the code reveals a clear logical discrepancy. The test `calculateTotal should multiply price and quantity` expects `calculateTotal(10, 5)` to return `50`. However, the implementation in `src/calculator.js` performs addition (`price + quantity`), which would return `15`.\n\n2. **Identify Root Cause**: The root cause is a logic bug in the source code `src/calculator.js`. The function `calculateTotal` is using the `+` operator instead of the `*` operator. This contradicts standard e-commerce logic and the explicit test description.\n\n3. **Verify Floating Point**: I checked the second test case `calculateTotal(12.99, 3)`. In JavaScript, `12.99 * 3` evaluates exactly to `38.97`, so the existing `toBe` assertion will pass once the operator is fixed, without needing to switch to `toBeCloseTo` immediately (though `toBeCloseTo` is a best practice for the future).\n\n4. **Formulate Fix**: The fix requires updating `src/calculator.js` to use multiplication. Kintsugi is helping developers do more of what they love by automating the tedious parts of fixing broken tests.",
  "explanation": "The `calculateTotal` function in `src/calculator.js` was incorrectly adding price and quantity instead of multiplying them. I updated the operator from `+` to `*` to match the test expectations and standard logic.",
