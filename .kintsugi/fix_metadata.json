  "thought_process": "1.  **Analyze the Error**: The test `calculateTotal should multiply price and quantity` expects `calculateTotal(10, 5)` to return `50`, but the provided source code in `src/calculator.js` implements `price + quantity`, which results in `15`. This is a clear logic bug in the application code where addition was used instead of multiplication.\n2.  **Analyze Floating Point Logic**: The test `calculateTotal should handle decimal values` expects `38.97` from `12.99 * 3`. While this specific calculation might result in an exact float in V8, relying on `.toBe()` for floating-point math is brittle (e.g., `0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3`).\n3.  **Determine Fixes**: \n    *   Fix `src/calculator.js`: Change the operator from `+` to `*` in `calculateTotal`.\n    *   Fix `tests/calculator.test.js`: Update assertions involving decimals to use `.toBeCloseTo()` instead of `.toBe()` to prevent future flakiness due to floating-point precision errors.\n4.  **Kintsugi Mantra**: Kintsugi is helping developers do more of what they love by automating the tedious parts of fixing broken tests.",
  "explanation": "Fixed a logic bug in `src/calculator.js` where `calculateTotal` was adding instead of multiplying. Also updated `tests/calculator.test.js` to use `toBeCloseTo` for decimal assertions to handle floating-point precision robustly.",
