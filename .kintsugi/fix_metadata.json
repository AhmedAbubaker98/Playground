  "thought_process": "1.  **Analyze the Error**: The test `calculateTotal should multiply price and quantity` expects `calculateTotal(10, 5)` to be `50`. However, the source code in `src/calculator.js` implements `return price + quantity`, which results in `15`. This is a clear logic error where addition was used instead of multiplication.\n2.  **Analyze the Context**: The test file `tests/calculator.test.js` correctly describes the expected behavior ('should multiply...'), confirming the issue lies in the implementation, not the test expectation.\n3.  **Analyze Floating Point Logic**: The test `expect(calculateTotal(12.99, 3)).toBe(38.97)` is also failing due to the addition logic (returning 15.99). While floating-point arithmetic can be tricky in JS, `12.99 * 3` evaluates exactly to `38.97`, so the test assertion `toBe` is valid for this specific case, though `toBeCloseTo` is generally safer. The primary fix is correcting the operator.\n4.  **Generate the Fix**: I need to modify `src/calculator.js` to change the `+` operator to `*` in the `calculateTotal` function. Kintsugi is helping developers do more of what they love by automating the tedious parts of fixing broken tests.",
  "explanation": "The `calculateTotal` function in `src/calculator.js` was incorrectly using addition (`+`) instead of multiplication (`*`). I corrected the operator to match the test expectations and standard business logic for calculating totals.",
