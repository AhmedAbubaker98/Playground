  "thought_process": "1.  **Analyze the Persistence of Failure**: The error `Error: http://localhost:3000 is already used` persisted despite my previous attempt to set `reuseExistingServer: true`. This indicates that either the configuration change wasn't sufficient to override the CI environment's behavior, or the conflict is fundamental to how the CI pipeline is structured.\n\n2.  **Analyze the CI Pipeline**: The logs show Step 6 (`Run npm run dev &`) explicitly starts the server, and Step 7 waits for it. Step 8 runs Playwright. In this specific 'Gauntlet' environment, the server is *externally managed*. Playwright's `webServer` block is trying to claim a port that is already locked by Step 6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Root Cause**: The `webServer` configuration in `playwright.config.js` is redundant and conflicting in CI. While `reuseExistingServer: true` *should* work, it is safer and more robust to simply **remove** the `webServer` configuration when running in CI. This forces Playwright to rely on the `baseURL` and the externally running server, bypassing the port binding check entirely.\n\n4.  **Refine the Fix**: \n    *   **Config**: Modify `playwright.config.js` to conditionally include the `webServer` block only when *not* in CI (`!process.env.CI`). This preserves local development convenience (where the server needs to be started) while fixing the CI conflict.\n    *   **Test**: Re-apply the timeout fix to `tests/e2e/01_temporal.spec.js` because the test hasn't actually run yet. Once the config issue is resolved, the 'Async Button' will likely still time out if the default 5s limit isn't increased.",
  "explanation": "The CI pipeline manually starts the server before running tests, causing a port conflict when Playwright also attempts to manage the server. I modified `playwright.config.js` to only define the `webServer` block when *not* running in CI, allowing Playwright to connect to the pre-existing server instance without error. I also kept the increased timeout in the test file to handle the expected delay of the async button.",
